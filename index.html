        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) is a global media and entertainment company primarily known for its professional wrestling events. The scripted, story-based matches are referred to by the company as "sports entertainment". 
Business and company structure
In September 2023, WWE merged with Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) to form a new parent company, TKO Group Holdings, majority-owned by Endeavor. Ari Emanuel is the CEO of TKO, while Paul "Triple H" Levesque is WWE's Chief Content Officer. WWE operates as a division within TKO, hosting over 300 live events annually and reaching more than 1 billion homes globally with its programming. 
Programming and brands
WWE organizes performers into brands featured on different TV programs. Key shows include Raw (Netflix, Monday nights), SmackDown (USA Network, Friday nights), and NXT (The CW), which started as a developmental brand but is now a primary one. Other shows include Main Event (Peacock) featuring matches from across brands and Evolve (Tubi) showcasing rising talent. Premium Live Events, formerly pay-per-views, feature all brands and include major annual events like WrestleMania. 
Notable history
Founded as Capitol Wrestling Corporation in 1953, the company left the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in 1963 to become the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). It later became the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979. The 1990s saw the "Attitude Era," a period of intense competition with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) featuring stars like "Stone Cold" Steve Austin. In 2002, the company changed its name to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) due to a trademark dispute. WWE has implemented brand splits, notably from 2002–2011 and 2016–present, to showcase its large roster.
